            |The simple scientific calculator.
            |Supported operators:
            |   1) Addition (+) and subtraction (-);
            |   2) Multiplication (*) and division (/);
            |   3) Unary plus (+) and unary minus (-);
            |   4) Exponentiation (^);
            |   5) Factorial (!) and percent (%);
            |The calculator also supports an implicit multiplication operator, for example, the expression "1a"
            |is equivalent to "1*a", but "a1" is not equivalent to "a*1", in this case "a1" is the only identifier.
            |Parentheses and square brackets can be used to change the order of operations in expressions.
            |The calculator has the set of built-in functions. To see all functions enter the following command:
            |   \functions
            |You can declare variables using the following syntax:
            |   <identifier> = <expression>
            |Identifiers are case-sensitive. The constants pi and e (Euler number) are defined by default.
            |Reassign of these constants is forbidden.
            |To exit the program, run the /exit command or press CTRL-D keystroke.
